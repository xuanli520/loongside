## Running Spec Files

```bash
loongclaw run-spec --spec examples/spec/runtime-extension.json --print-audit
loongclaw run-spec --spec examples/spec/tool-search-trusted.json --render-summary
```

`--print-audit` shows the full audit trail for the execution.
`--render-summary` writes a compact operator-facing summary to `stderr` while
preserving the full JSON report on `stdout`.

Generate a trust-guarded starter spec:

```bash
loongclaw init-spec --preset plugin-trust-guard --output loongclaw.plugin-trust.json
```

Run all spec files:

```bash
for spec in examples/spec/*.json; do
  echo "--- Running: $spec ---"
  loongclaw run-spec --spec "$spec" --print-audit
done
```

## Running Benchmarks

Programmatic pressure benchmark:

```bash
loongclaw benchmark-programmatic-pressure \
  --matrix examples/benchmarks/programmatic-pressure-matrix.json \
  --enforce-gate
```

WASM cache benchmark:

```bash
loongclaw benchmark-wasm-cache \
  --wasm examples/plugins-wasm/secure_echo.wasm \
  --enforce-gate
```

Optional runtime tuning:

```bash
# default = 32, max = 4096
LOONGCLAW_WASM_CACHE_CAPACITY=64 loongclaw benchmark-wasm-cache \
  --wasm examples/plugins-wasm/secure_echo.wasm \
  --enforce-gate
```

Convenience scripts:

```bash
./scripts/benchmark_programmatic_pressure.sh
./scripts/benchmark_wasm_cache.sh
```

## Plugin Examples

- `plugins/openrouter_plugin.rs` -- Rust plugin with embedded `LOONGCLAW_PLUGIN_START` / `LOONGCLAW_PLUGIN_END` manifest markers. This example is marked `verified-community` so tool search and catalog reports surface a non-default trust tier.
- `plugins-wasm/secure_wasm_plugin.rs` -- WASM plugin Rust source. Compiled to `secure_echo.wasm`, with an `official` trust tier for first-party runtime examples.
- `plugins-process/stdio_echo_plugin.py` -- Python stdio echo plugin for process-bridge testing. This example stays explicitly `unverified` so the trust-policy fixtures can demonstrate blocked auto-apply without hiding the plugin from scan/search results.

Tool search and bootstrap reports now surface `trust_tier` and `provenance_summary` fields for scanned plugin-backed providers. `run-spec` reports also include a top-level `plugin_trust_summary`, so operator review can see tier counts and review-required high-risk plugins without manually diffing raw scan/bootstrap arrays. `tool_search` accepts both inline query prefixes like `trust:official` / `tier:verified-community` and a structured `trust_tiers` array on the operation payload when specs need deterministic trust-aware discovery. The `tool_search` outcome now also carries a `trust_filter_summary` block so operators can see which trust scope was requested, how many candidates were filtered out, and whether conflicting trust constraints collapsed the result set. For quick operator review, `run-spec` also mirrors this into a top-level `tool_search_summary` with the query, returned count, trust scope, and compact top-result cards, and `loongclaw run-spec --render-summary` renders the same trust-aware summary to `stderr` without breaking JSON consumers. The audit lane now also records `ToolSearchEvaluated` events, so `loongclaw audit recent`, `loongclaw audit summary`, and the dedicated `loongclaw audit discovery` subcommand can surface trust-filter conflicts and trust-filtered empty discovery outcomes directly, including trust-scope rollups, the last triage label, a compact context summary, and an operator hint for what to adjust next.

When auditing retained history, you can now narrow the view to the relevant trust-aware events directly:

```bash
loongclaw audit recent --kind tool-search-evaluated --limit 5
loongclaw audit recent --kind tool-search-evaluated --query-contains "trust:official" --trust-tier official
loongclaw audit summary --triage-label tool-search-trust-conflict
loongclaw audit summary --group-by token
loongclaw audit discovery --query-contains "trust:official" --trust-tier official
loongclaw audit discovery --group-by agent
loongclaw audit discovery --since-epoch-s 1700010051 --until-epoch-s 1700010052 --query-contains "catalog"
loongclaw audit recent --pack-id tool-search-trusted-pack --agent-id agent-tool-search-trusted
loongclaw audit recent --event-id evt-tool-search-conflict --token-id token-tool-search
loongclaw audit token-trail --token-id token-tool-search --limit 20
```

The `limit` applies after filtering, so these commands return the most recent matching events instead of trimming the full journal first. `audit discovery` also preloads the `ToolSearchEvaluated` kind filter and aggregates requested/effective trust tiers so operators can review trust-aware discovery drift without manually composing event-kind filters. When you need to isolate one rollout or incident window, `audit recent`, `audit summary`, and `audit discovery` also accept inclusive `--since-epoch-s` / `--until-epoch-s` filters and echo those bounds back in text and JSON output.
They also accept `--pack-id` and `--agent-id`, which is useful when retained history contains overlapping validation runs from multiple packs or operators. For exact retained drill-down, `--event-id` and `--token-id` can be layered on top of those broader filters; the token filter follows typed `TokenIssued`, `TokenRevoked`, and `AuthorizationDenied` events, so one credential incident can be reconstructed without ad-hoc journal grep.
`audit summary --group-by pack|agent|token` gives a grouped operator rollup over the same filtered window, which is useful when you need to see whether failures cluster around one workload, one operator session, or one token family before drilling into a specific trail.
`audit discovery --group-by pack|agent` does the same for trust-aware tool-search history, but keeps the trust-tier and triage rollups intact so you can see which pack or agent is producing the most trust-filter conflicts or empty discovery outcomes.
Each grouped discovery row also includes a `drill_down_command` that replays the same retained slice through `audit recent`, including `--query-contains` / `--trust-tier` when those filters were active, so operators can jump from hotspot rollups to exact event windows without rebuilding the command.
The same grouped row now also includes a `correlated_summary_command`, which broadens that hotspot into `audit summary` over the same workload identity and time bounds so adjacent failover, authorization, or bootstrap triage can be correlated quickly.
Grouped discovery output now also shows a compact correlated summary preview beside that command, so operators can see the widened event-kind and triage counts before they pivot.
That preview now also exposes a focused signal summary with `additional_events`, non-discovery counts, and an `attention_hint`, so adjacent audit trouble stands out immediately.
The same focused layer now also includes a `remediation_hint`, which maps the strongest adjacent triage or event family to the next operator action worth taking.
When that mapping is deterministic, grouped discovery now also emits a `correlated_remediation_command`, so operators can jump directly into the next filtered audit view instead of translating the hint by hand.
When you want that reconstruction as a first-class operator surface instead of an ad-hoc filtered window, `audit token-trail` renders the token lifecycle directly and reports when the retained view has been truncated by the selected limit.

## Security Policy Profiles

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `policy/approval-medium-balanced.json` | Medium-balanced human approval profile. High-risk tool calls require explicit authorization; low-risk calls stay fast. |
| `policy/security-scan-medium-balanced.json` | Medium-balanced security scan profile with `block_on_high` gate. |

These profiles are loaded by the policy engine at runtime. See [Layered Kernel Design](../docs/design-docs/layered-kernel-design.md) L1 for policy semantics.
