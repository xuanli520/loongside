## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0-alpha.2] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- Added a fast-lane summary command for chat flows to surface concise delegate context faster.
- Surfaced the delegate child runtime contract in the app runtime so downstream tooling can reason about effective delegation behavior.

### Changed

- Tightened delegate prompt summary visibility and aligned the effective runtime contract with stricter disabled-tool coverage.
- Hardened the dev-to-main release promotion lifecycle and source enforcement in CI.
- Expanded delegate runtime, private-host, and process stdio test coverage to stabilize the prerelease line before broader promotion.
- Refreshed contributor governance and README visuals, including new Chinese SVG diagrams and restored core harness docs changes.

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- Introduced the fresh `0.1.0-alpha.1` prerelease line for LoongClaw as a secure Rust foundation for vertical AI agents.
- Preserved the baseline CLI path around guided onboarding, ask or chat flows, doctor repair, and multi-surface delivery for early team evaluation.

### Changed

- Reset canonical release history on `dev` to the new prerelease baseline after invalidating the earlier tracked `0.1.x` release line.
- Made release governance prerelease-aware and seeded contributor notes from the current source snapshot instead of inheriting the invalidated prior tag range.
