# Chat Diagnostics Binding Normalization Design

Date: 2026-03-16
Scope: follow-up for issue #191 on `alpha-test`

## Problem

`ConversationRuntimeBinding` already exists to make conversation execution mode
explicit, but the CLI chat diagnostics layer still leaks back to raw
`Option<&KernelContext>`.

The remaining drift is concentrated in:

1. `crates/app/src/chat.rs`
   - `print_history(...)`
   - `print_safe_lane_summary(...)`
   - `print_turn_checkpoint_summary(...)`
   - `print_turn_checkpoint_repair(...)`
2. `crates/app/src/conversation/session_history.rs`
   - `load_discovery_first_event_summary(...)`

These helpers either:

1. accept `Option<&KernelContext>` even when the caller already knows the
   runtime mode, or
2. immediately convert that optional kernel context back into
   `ConversationRuntimeBinding`.

That does not create a new exploit on its own, but it weakens the type-level
contract around governed versus direct execution and makes future drift easier.

## Goals

1. Keep chat diagnostics on explicit `ConversationRuntimeBinding<'_>`.
2. Keep the session-history discovery-first summary helper on the same explicit
   binding contract as the neighboring history helpers.
3. Preserve current behavior:
   - kernel-bound callers still use kernel memory windows
   - direct callers still use direct/sqlite history paths
   - user-facing command output remains unchanged
4. Keep the slice small enough for a standalone issue and PR.

## Non-goals

1. Do not normalize the remaining provider-layer `Option<&KernelContext>` seams.
2. Do not widen this slice into turn-loop or ACP work.
3. Do not redesign history summary rendering or CLI output formats.

## Alternatives Considered

### A. Leave chat diagnostics alone because they are "just CLI helpers"

Rejected. These helpers are user-facing orchestration boundaries. Leaving them
optional-context-based keeps the conversation runtime story weaker exactly where
operator tooling is supposed to be truthful.

### B. Resume the broad conversation binding normalization refactor

Rejected for this branch. The broader 2026-03-15 plan spans multiple files and
surfaces. This follow-up should land a tighter, lower-risk slice that directly
matches issue #191.

### C. Normalize only the chat diagnostics and discovery-first helper

Recommended. It removes the most obvious optional-context leftovers at the CLI
diagnostic boundary without dragging in unrelated conversation internals.

## Proposed Design

Use `ConversationRuntimeBinding<'_>` directly in the remaining chat diagnostic
helpers and in `load_discovery_first_event_summary(...)`.

Concrete changes:

1. `chat.rs`
   - command dispatch sites pass `ConversationRuntimeBinding::kernel(&runtime.kernel_ctx)`
   - helper signatures accept `ConversationRuntimeBinding<'_>`
   - `print_history(...)` calls `binding.kernel_context()` only at the leaf that
     branches between kernel-backed memory windows and direct history loading
2. `session_history.rs`
   - `load_discovery_first_event_summary(...)` accepts binding directly
   - it reuses the same `load_assistant_contents_from_session_window(...)`
     contract as adjacent helpers without re-deriving binding from an option

## Expected Outcome

After this slice:

1. chat diagnostics no longer encode execution mode as `Some/None`
2. the conversation history helper surface becomes more internally consistent
3. the governed/runtime narrative becomes slightly more truthful without
   changing runtime behavior

## Test Strategy

Add focused regression coverage that proves:

1. chat diagnostic helpers compile and run when called with explicit
   `ConversationRuntimeBinding::direct()`
2. the discovery-first history helper compiles and runs with explicit direct and
   kernel bindings
3. existing summary/checkpoint behavior stays unchanged

The tests do not need to prove new behavior. They need to prove that the
binding contract has become explicit at these remaining seams.
