# LoongClaw Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-03-14

This roadmap is execution-focused. Every stage has:

- concrete deliverables
- explicit security and stability gates
- test and CI acceptance criteria

## North Star

Build a layered Agentic OS kernel that is:

- minimal at the core
- strong at policy and safety boundaries
- deeply integrable in both directions (others integrate LoongClaw, LoongClaw integrates others)
- hot-pluggable and community-extensible without core mutation
- customizable into vertical domain systems through declarative packs

## Architecture Invariants

1. Core contracts stay small and stable.
2. Rich behavior lands in extension planes, plugin packs, and connectors.
3. High-risk actions require human authorization under policy.
4. Untrusted plugins default to strict scan + restricted runtime.
5. Every security-critical decision must be auditable.

## Stage 0: Kernel Contract Freeze (Done)

Status: complete  
Focus: create minimal but strong core boundaries.

Delivered:

- core/extension split for `runtime`, `tool`, `memory`, `connector`
- capability-based policy engine and policy extension chain
- deterministic audit timeline and event sink abstraction
- vertical pack capability/connectors boundary model

Exit criteria met:

- core boundaries enforced by unit tests
- deterministic audit schema tests passing
- property tests for capability boundary invariants passing

## Stage 1: Baseline Security & Governance (In Progress)

Status: in progress  
Focus: medium-balanced defaults + hard stops for high-risk behavior.

Delivered:

- medium-balanced human approval model with:
  - per-call allow mode
  - one-time full-access mode
  - denylist precedence
  - external risk profile loading
- plugin bridge support matrix and checksum integrity lock
- plugin security scan with `block_on_high`
- external profile integrity lock (`security_scan.profile_sha256`) with fail-closed behavior
- external profile signature verification (`security_scan.profile_signature`, ed25519)
- JSONL SIEM export lane (`security_scan.siem_export`) with optional fail-closed mode
- kernel-level tool-call policy gate (`PolicyEngine::check_tool_call`) with explicit
  deny/approval-required outcomes before tool dispatch (Rule of Two)
- WASM static scan controls:
  - allowed artifact paths
  - module size cap
  - digest pin support
  - import policy (`allow_wasi`, blocked prefixes)
- typed audit emission for security scan summary (`SecurityScanEvaluated`)
- per-finding correlation IDs for deterministic audit aggregation

Remaining:

- profile signing key lifecycle (rotation/revocation) and trust anchor management
- SIEM transport adapters beyond file JSONL (HTTP/syslog/event bus)

Exit criteria:

- all high-risk tool calls blocked without explicit approval
- blocked community plugin paths demonstrably fail closed
- security scan and approval decisions both visible in structured audit

## Stage 2: Safe Hotplug Runtime (Next)

Status: in progress  
Focus: runtime-grade isolation for untrusted extension execution.

Delivered in current baseline:

- WASM runtime execution lane wired into `bridge_execution` with Wasmtime backend.
- Policy-driven runtime guardrails in `bridge_support.security_scan.runtime`:
  - required `allowed_path_prefixes` when `execute_wasm_component=true` (fail closed)
  - `max_component_bytes`
  - optional `fuel_limit`
- Runtime isolation tests for:
  - successful wasm execution
  - runtime prefix denial
  - runtime size-limit denial
  - invalid runtime policy denial

Remaining deliverables:

- WASM runtime lane with enforced resource limits:
  - CPU budget refinement
  - memory limits
  - timeout/termination policy
- process bridge sandbox profile tiers (`restricted`, `balanced`, `trusted`)
- hot-reload lifecycle hooks:
  - pre-load validation
  - rollback-on-failure
  - post-load health check

Acceptance criteria:

- runtime isolation e2e tests (normal + adversarial cases) passing
- deterministic rollback behavior validated under injected failures
- no core-path mutation allowed by plugin hotplug workflow

## Stage 3: Autonomous Integration Expansion (In Progress)

Status: in progress  
Focus: dynamic provider/channel integration without hardcoding.

Delivered in current baseline:

- protocol foundation crate (`crates/protocol`) with:
  - transport contract (`Transport` trait + typed frame envelopes)
  - typed method routing (`ProtocolRoute`) and policy-aware resolver (`ProtocolRouter`)
  - route authorization contract (`RouteAuthorizationRequest`) for deterministic
    auth/capability gates before handler dispatch
  - json-line stream transport (`JsonLineTransport`) for stdio/pipe integration
    with deterministic decode/error handling and close semantics
  - daemon `process_stdio` bridge now executes through protocol json-line frames
    (request/response method + payload envelope), with runtime evidence
    (`transport_kind`, request/response frame metadata) and deterministic
    failure surfacing for malformed frame responses
  - daemon `process_stdio` bridge hardening:
    - protocol route authorization gate before process execution
    - response contract checks (method/id must match request)
    - bounded send/close/recv/exit timeouts (`process_timeout_ms`)
  - daemon `http_json` bridge hardening:
    - protocol route authorization gate before HTTP request

      validating response `method` + `id`
    - bounded HTTP timeout parsing with deterministic clamp (`http_timeout_ms`)
  - shared protocol context builder for bridge executors to keep
    authorization/route semantics consistent across transport lanes
  - shared runtime evidence appender for protocol request/route/capability
    fields to keep bridge telemetry schemas aligned across executors
  - bridge protocol helpers split into a dedicated module include
    (`spec_bridge_protocol.inc.rs`) to reduce spec runtime file growth
  - bridge-focused spec runtime tests split into dedicated module
    (`tests/spec_runtime_bridge.rs`) to reduce test-file maintenance debt
  - typed bridge runtime evidence structs with shared serialization path to
    reduce ad-hoc JSON field drift across executors
  - explicit runtime evidence state variants (`BaseOnly`/`RequestOnly`/
    `Response` or `Execution`) to avoid impossible field combinations
  - strict/lenient custom route control to avoid ad-hoc string dispatch at call sites
  - linked in-memory `ChannelTransport` primitive with:
    - bounded queue backpressure
    - explicit close semantics
    - deterministic async transport tests (roundtrip, close behavior, backpressure)
- `tool_search` operation for runtime tool discovery over:
  - loaded providers in integration catalog
  - scanned-but-not-absorbed plugin descriptors
- translation-aligned retrieval payloads:

  - plugin semantic fields (`summary`, `tags`, `input_examples`, `output_examples`, `defer_loading`)
- `programmatic_tool_call` operation for server-side tool orchestration:
  - step model (`set_literal`, `json_pointer`, `connector_call`, `connector_batch`, `conditional`)
  - connector allowlist and call-budget enforcement
  - batch execution controls (`parallel`, `continue_on_error`) with per-call structured outcomes
  - branch predicates (`equals`, `exists`) for deterministic conditional routing

  - deterministic adaptive retry jitter (`jitter_ratio`, `adaptive_jitter`)
  - per-connector rate shaping policy (`connector_rate_limits.<connector>.min_interval_ms`)
  - per-connector circuit breaker policy (`failure_threshold`, `cooldown_ms`,
    `half_open_max_calls`, `success_threshold`)
  - adaptive concurrency policy (`concurrency`) with:
    - global in-flight cap (`max_in_flight`)
    - explicit floor and ramp profile (`min_in_flight`, adaptive up/down steps)
    - fair scheduling policy (`weighted_round_robin` / `strict_round_robin`)
    - per-call priority classes (`high` / `normal` / `low`)
    - policy-driven adaptive budget contraction/recovery triggers (`adaptive_reduce_on`)
  - scheduler telemetry for fanout (`dispatch_order`, `peak_in_flight`,
    `budget_reductions`, `budget_increases`, `final_in_flight_budget`)
  - typed programmatic error taxonomy (`programmatic_error[code]`, batch `error_code`)
  - return-step targeting and optional intermediate traces
  - payload templating (`{{step_id}}`, `{{step_id#/json/pointer}}`)
- dynamic connector caller ACL:
  - `allowed_callers` and `allowed_callers_json` metadata gates
  - automatic `_loongclaw.caller` provenance injection for programmatic calls
- active `http_json` runtime execution lane (no longer plan-only):

- advertised tools match the actually invokable runtime surface for the current config and compiled features
- channel/provider modules can be toggled by feature flags without core code edits

## Quality Gate Matrix (Always On)

All roadmap stages must keep these gates green:

1. `cargo fmt`
2. `cargo test` (workspace full pass)
3. Security regression set (approval, scan, bridge constraints)
4. Audit schema stability checks for critical event kinds
5. No hardcoded risk exceptions when config-driven alternatives exist

## Discussion: Post-MVP Foundation Items

These items emerged from the Phase 0–3 restructure (PR #15). They are candidates for near-term work but need prioritization discussion before commitment.

### D1: Wire Phase 3 primitives into production paths

Phase 3 added generation tokens, Fault, TaskState FSM, and Namespace as additive types with tests. They are not yet used in production code paths.

Candidates:
- Issue tokens with membrane scoped to Namespace during `bootstrap_kernel_context`
- Use `TaskSupervisor` in spec runner's `execute_task` path for FSM-enforced lifecycle
- Return `Fault` from kernel dispatch methods alongside `KernelError` for caller-side recovery matching
- Use generation-based revocation for session rotation (e.g., Telegram channel restart)

Trade-off: wiring now locks in the API surface; waiting allows more usage patterns to emerge.

### D2: Persistent audit sink

`InMemoryAuditSink` loses all audit events on process restart. For security-critical decisions (policy denials, token revocations) to be auditable post-incident, a durable sink is needed.

Options:
- SQLite audit table (reuse existing rusqlite dependency)
- Append-only JSONL file (simplest, grep-friendly)
- SIEM export lane (already planned in Stage 1)

Trade-off: SQLite is queryable but adds schema migration burden. JSONL is zero-schema but harder to query.

### D3: Make `persist_turn` async

`persist_turn` currently uses `tokio::task::block_in_place` to bridge sync → async kernel calls. This works but blocks a tokio worker thread and panics on single-threaded runtimes.

Approach: make `ConversationRuntime::persist_turn` async, update `ConversationOrchestrator` callers. Straightforward but touches 6+ files.

Trade-off: low risk, moderate churn. Unblocks single-threaded runtime compatibility.

### D4: Route `build_messages` memory window through kernel

`build_messages_for_session` in the MVP provider layer couples system prompt construction with SQLite memory window loading. The memory-read portion should route through the kernel's memory plane for policy/audit coverage.

Approach: split `build_messages_for_session` into prompt construction + kernel-routed memory read. Requires new `MemoryCoreRequest` operation (e.g., `read_window`).

Trade-off: improves audit coverage for memory reads, but requires splitting a tightly coupled function.

Status (alpha-test): implemented.
- Added `ConversationContextEngine` seam and default implementation.
- `build_messages` now assembles through context engine and routes memory window reads via `kernel.execute_memory_core(..., Capability::MemoryRead, ...)` when kernel context is present.
- Added registry/selection hooks (`register_context_engine`, `resolve_context_engine`, `LOONGCLAW_CONTEXT_ENGINE`) plus config-based selector (`[conversation].context_engine`) for future multi-engine evolution without invasive runtime refactors.
- Added built-in `legacy` engine for rollback and behavior comparison against pre-seam assembly path.
- Added engine metadata surface (`id`, `api_version`, `capabilities`) for diagnostics and compatibility checks before introducing more advanced engines.
- Added explicit post-turn context compaction hook (`compact_context`) to reserve an upgrade seam for summarization/compression without rewriting orchestrator flow.
- Added reserved context-engine lifecycle hooks (`bootstrap`, `ingest`) as default no-op seams so future engine-owned import/indexing flows do not require another trait/runtime rewrite.
- Added reserved subagent lifecycle hooks (`prepare_subagent_spawn`, `on_subagent_ended`) as default no-op seams so future multi-agent context wiring avoids trait-breaking refactors.
- Added richer context assembly output (`messages`, optional `estimated_tokens`, optional `system_prompt_addition`) to pre-wire policy/runtime prompt augmentation without revisiting runtime boundaries.
- Added compaction policy controls (`compact_enabled`, `compact_min_messages`, `compact_trigger_estimated_tokens`, `compact_fail_open`) so heavy future summarization can be enabled/tuned without orchestrator rewrites.
- Added daemon observability command (`list-context-engines`) to show selected engine source (env/config/default) and available engine capabilities.
- Added unified runtime snapshot assembly for context engine diagnostics (selected + available + compaction policy) to keep CLI/channel observability outputs consistent.
- Added regression tests for kernel-routed window reads, runtime injection, and registry resolution.

### D5: Upgrade `InMemoryAuditSink` to queryable snapshot

Current `InMemoryAuditSink::snapshot()` returns a full clone of all events. For long-running processes, this grows unboundedly.

Options:
- Add ring-buffer with configurable capacity
- Add filtered snapshot (by time range, event kind, pack_id)
- Combine with D2 (persistent sink replaces in-memory for production)

Trade-off: if D2 lands, this becomes test-only infrastructure. May not be worth optimizing independently.

## Current Priority Order

1. Stage 2 hardening: memory/timeout isolation + sandbox tiers
2. Stage 2 hot-reload reliability: pre/post checks + rollback contract
3. Stage 3 baseline: connector contract versioning and idempotent reconciliation
