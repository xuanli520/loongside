# Security

Security domain index for LoongClaw. For vulnerability reporting, see [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) at repository root.

## Security Model

LoongClaw implements a multi-layer security model. Higher layers add defense-in-depth:

| Layer | Mechanism | Version | Status |
|-------|-----------|---------|--------|
| 0 | Rust memory safety (compile-time, zero overhead) | v0.1 | Enforced |
| 1 | Capability-based access (type-system tokens) | v0.1 | Enforced |
| 2 | Namespace confinement (per-task resource view) | v0.1 | Struct exists, not enforced |
| 3 | WASM linear memory sandbox | v0.2 | Research only |
| 4 | Process isolation (seccomp+Landlock / restricted child) | v0.1 | Not implemented |

## Enforcement Points

### Policy Engine (L1)

Every kernel-bound core tool call passes through capability + policy gates:

```
CapabilityToken → PolicyEngine.authorize(...) → PolicyExtensionChain → Execution → Audit
```

Tool-specific request approval currently lives in the `PolicyExtensionChain`; the legacy
`PolicyEngine::check_tool_call` hook is deprecated.

**Current coverage:**
- `shell.exec` — Kernel-mediated core tool execution with capability checks, shell policy extensions, and audit events
- `file.read` / `file.write` / `file.edit` — Kernel-mediated core tool execution with filesystem capabilities, file policy extension checks, execution-layer path sandboxing, and audit events
- Conversation tool turns — Fast-lane and safe-lane inner tool execution now flow through an explicit `ConversationRuntimeBinding` (`Kernel` or `Direct`); core tools require a bound `KernelContext`, missing authority is rejected at the binding boundary as `no_kernel_context`, and async delegate child turns now inherit parent kernel authority instead of forcing direct mode
- Memory/runtime/context orchestration — The conversation module now carries `ConversationRuntimeBinding` end-to-end across runtime, context, persistence, turn coordination, loop followup, history, and app-dispatch seams. Kernel-bound history readers fail closed on kernel memory-window errors or non-`ok` statuses instead of silently downgrading to direct sqlite
- Provider request/failover orchestration — Provider request entrypoints and failover telemetry now use an explicit `ProviderRuntimeBinding` (`Kernel` or `Direct`). Provider failover metrics record in both modes, while kernel-backed audit emission only occurs when provider execution is explicitly kernel-bound
- Outer integration wrappers — Raw optional kernel context is now limited to explicit integration boundaries such as `channel::process_inbound_with_provider`, which immediately normalize into a binding-first runtime seam instead of carrying shadow authority semantics deeper into the runtime
- Plugin intake and ownership — `PluginManifest::slot_claims` now enforces exclusive/shared/advisory ownership boundaries during absorb. Conflicting claims surface as blocked activation candidates before bootstrap where possible, still fail before catalog mutation if they reach absorb, and normalized claim metadata now projects into provider inventory, self-awareness activation inventory, plus spec `plugin_inventory` / `tool_search` visibility
- Plugin host compatibility — `PluginManifest::compatibility` now lets packages declare supported host API and version requirements. Invalid or incompatible declarations fail closed during absorb, surface as `blocked_incompatible_host` during activation planning, and project into operator-facing inventory so incompatible plugins stay discoverable without becoming active by accident
- Plugin package contract strictness — package manifests now require explicit `api_version` plus top-level `version`, reject unknown top-level fields, reject legacy `metadata.version`, reserve the `plugin_*` metadata namespace for host-managed projection, and validate typed plugin `version` as semver. This closes a silent-drift class where SDK authors or third-party packages could misspell contract keys, publish dual version truth, or collide with host inventory metadata while still appearing to load successfully
- Plugin diagnostics contract — plugin scan warnings and activation blockers now project as structured diagnostics with stable codes, severity, lifecycle phase, blocking truth, field paths, and remediation hints across inventory/search/self-awareness surfaces. This keeps operator tooling and future SDK/marketplace checks on one machine-readable governance vocabulary instead of fragile string matching
- Plugin preflight governance — the spec/runtime layer now exposes a profile-aware `plugin_preflight` surface that reuses the same diagnostics and activation truth for current-host activation gates, SDK release gates, and stricter marketplace submission gates instead of letting each external tool invent its own policy parser
- Policy integrity and traceability — plugin preflight governance policies can now be loaded from external JSON, pinned by sha256, optionally signature-verified, and echoed back through policy source/version/checksum metadata so CI, private registries, and future marketplaces can prove they evaluated plugins against the same rule set; explicitly requested custom policies fail closed on load/validation errors instead of silently downgrading to the bundled policy
- Activation attestation boundary — ready plugin absorbs now stamp a checksum-pinned `plugin_activation_contract_json` into provider metadata, and runtime bridge dispatch verifies both the attested checksum and the current provider projection before allowing foreign-compatibility execution. Partial, malformed, or drifted attestation metadata is treated as a fail-closed compatibility-contract breach instead of falling back to best-effort runtime inference
- Operator-facing attestation truth — loaded-plugin `tool_search`, `plugin_inventory`, and `plugin_preflight` surfaces now expose whether activation attestation is `verified`, `missing`, or `invalid`, including checksum drift context when available. The default `runtime_activation` preflight lane blocks loaded plugins whose attested activation contract no longer verifies and emits explicit `quarantine_loaded_provider` plus `repair_runtime_attestation` remediation classes, so current-host readiness cannot silently pass on catalog drift or metadata corruption
- Structured governance actions — plugin preflight recommended actions now also carry a typed `operator_action` envelope with a stable `action_id`, owning surface, action kind, target plugin/provider identity, reload requirement, and follow-up preflight profile, so host automation can route or persist plugin governance actions without scraping free-form remediation text
- Governance workload aggregation — plugin preflight summary output now also emits a deduplicated `operator_action_plan` and counts distinct operator actions by surface, by kind, and by reload requirement so host dashboards and policy automation can estimate runtime versus packaging versus review work from one machine-readable report
- Thin operator CLI boundary — the daemon-facing `loongclaw plugins preflight` and `loongclaw plugins actions` commands intentionally consume the existing `plugin_preflight` spec contract and its structured summary/action-plan output instead of embedding a second policy evaluator in the operator layer. This keeps SDK/open ecosystem compatibility logic outside the kernel core without weakening fail-closed governance
- Bundled compatibility presets — plugin governance now also exposes checksum-pinnable bundled bridge support profiles such as `native-balanced` and `openclaw-ecosystem-balanced`, so hosts can opt into broader foreign-ecosystem compatibility through explicit runtime matrices instead of silently widening support by ambient config drift
- Discoverable preset surface — `loongclaw plugins bridge-profiles` now exposes those bundled compatibility presets and their exact bridge/shim/language support matrix through one bounded operator CLI, reducing the chance that external tooling widens compatibility by reimplementing or guessing profile contents
- Machine-readable remediation contract — plugin preflight results now carry typed remediation classes plus structured recommended actions, so SDK packaging flows, CI, and marketplace moderation can automate on one stable remediation vocabulary instead of reverse-engineering free-form policy summaries
- Baseline versus effective governance truth — plugin preflight now reports both baseline verdicts and effective post-policy outcomes, including waived flags/codes and summary-level baseline counters, so approval tooling can see whether a plugin passed cleanly or only after a documented exception
- Ecosystem observability rollups — plugin preflight summary output now also aggregates source kind, dialect, compatibility mode, source language, and bridge kind distributions so operators can spot foreign-dialect or shim-profile expansion from one bounded report instead of correlating raw plugin rows by hand
- Contract-drift exception lane only — custom preflight policy exceptions are explicit and auditable, but are intentionally limited to manifest/package drift findings such as embedded-source migration or legacy metadata cleanup; they cannot waive activation blockers, unsupported runtime bridges, slot ownership conflicts, or other kernel fail-closed runtime boundaries
- Version-scoped and approval-attested waivers — every preflight exception can now be narrowed to a plugin semver range and must carry stable `ticket_ref` plus `approved_by` metadata; summary output separately tracks clean passes versus waived passes and aggregates waiver usage by ticket/approver so governance dashboards can spot grandfathering drift early
- Connector/ACP/runtime-only analytics — Not uniformly routed through the L1 policy chain yet

**Conversation runtime binding note:**
- The binding makes the high-level execution mode explicit: `Kernel` means the turn is allowed to call kernel-mediated core tools; `Direct` means conversation orchestration may continue, but kernel-only tool execution must fail closed.
- This removes ambiguity from conversation traits and dispatcher seams where `None` previously overloaded multiple meanings such as "direct mode", "not wired yet", or "forgot to pass kernel authority".
- Conversation app-dispatch approval routing is now binding-first at the trait boundary. `AppToolDispatcher` approval checks receive `ConversationRuntimeBinding` directly instead of reconstructing approval semantics from `Option<&KernelContext>`.
- Detached async delegate spawns carry an owned kernel context forward when the parent binding is kernel-bound. Direct-mode parents keep direct-mode children.
- Kernel-bound history helpers no longer reuse direct sqlite fallback behind the caller's back. Higher-level orchestration may still choose how to handle the surfaced error.
- Safe-lane governor diagnostics now surface history load status and normalized error codes instead of silently collapsing kernel history failures into an undifferentiated "no history" state.
- User-facing chat diagnostics now preserve explicit `ConversationRuntimeBinding` semantics end-to-end. The discovery-first session-history path uses the same binding-first implementation internally. Remaining public `Option<&KernelContext>` seams are compatibility wrappers only, not first-class dispatcher-boundary contracts.

**Provider runtime binding note:**
- The provider binding makes provider governance explicit without importing conversation-layer semantics into provider code. `Kernel` means failover/audit behavior may emit kernel-backed audit events; `Direct` means provider execution is intentionally running without that authority while still recording in-process failover metrics.

### Capability Tokens

- 8 capability types with generation-based revocation
- `AtomicU64` threshold: revoke all tokens with generation <= N
- TTL enforcement on every authorization check
- `membrane` field exists but not enforced (TD-003)

### Audit System

- 10 event kinds with atomic sequencing
- Production app runtimes default to durable JSONL retention via `[audit].mode = "fanout"`
- Default journal path: `~/.loongclaw/audit/events.jsonl`
- `LoongClawKernel::new()` and spec/test/demo helpers may still opt into explicit in-memory audit seams when side-effect-free snapshot reporting is required
- Explicit no-audit behavior remains opt-in only and should stay reserved for narrow fixture seams
- No HMAC chain for tamper evidence (TD-007)

### Operator Security Posture Audit

- `loong doctor security` is the operator-facing exposure audit for the current local runtime
- It reports `covered`, `partial`, `exposed`, and `unknown` findings instead of collapsing everything into pass/fail
- Current audit categories include durable audit retention, shell posture, tool file-root confinement, web-fetch egress, external-skills posture, secret hygiene, and browser automation surfaces
- `loong doctor security --json` provides a stable machine-readable report for local automation and support workflows

### Web HTTP SSRF Guardrails

- `web.fetch`, `web.search`, and the shared browser-side URL validators intentionally build their HTTP clients with `reqwest::ClientBuilder::no_proxy()`
- This keeps DNS resolution and connect-time routing inside the same SSRF-safe policy boundary instead of delegating host decisions to ambient `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`, or `NO_PROXY` environment settings
- The built-in browser surface now uses the same SSRF-safe client construction, so browser navigation no longer trusts ambient proxy environment variables for host reachability decisions
- The managed browser companion validates both the requested navigation target and the returned `page_url` against its runtime web policy, and it tears down companion session state if a returned `page_url` falls outside that policy
- Config-backed outbound channel endpoints now share one outbound HTTP trust policy: URLs must use `http` or `https`, must not embed credentials, and block private or special-use hosts by default
- Channel outbound HTTP clients do not auto-follow redirects, which prevents an initially trusted endpoint from silently crossing into a different destination after the first response
- Operators who intentionally target a local or private bridge can widen that boundary with `[outbound_http] allow_private_hosts = true`; the default remains fail-closed for public-only outbound delivery
- Trade-off: corporate proxy-only egress is not currently supported for these web tools because a proxy hop would weaken the same-host assumptions behind the private-address guard
- If proxy-aware web tooling is added later, it should preserve the same SSRF guarantees rather than silently bypassing them

### Shared Execution Security Tiers

LoongClaw now uses one shared execution-tier vocabulary across the process, browser, and WASM
lanes. The first slice standardizes the contract and the emitted evidence; it does not attempt a
full sandbox rewrite for every lane at once.

| Tier | Meaning | Current lane mapping |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| `restricted` | tightly bounded execution intended for untrusted or heavily constrained work | built-in browser tools and the current WASM component runtime lane |
| `balanced` | richer operator-governed execution with explicit readiness or allowlist gates | allowlisted `process_stdio` bridge execution and the managed browser companion when its runtime gate is open |
| `trusted` | reserved for future explicit high-trust execution lanes | no default lane maps here yet |

Current evidence surfaces that emit or expose this vocabulary:

- `process_stdio` bridge runtime evidence now includes `execution_tier`
- WASM bridge runtime evidence now includes `execution_tier`
- browser tool payloads and runtime snapshots now include `execution_tier`
