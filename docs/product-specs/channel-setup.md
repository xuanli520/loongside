# Channel Setup

This file is the repository-native source contract for Loong's shipped
channel surfaces, outbound-only delivery inventory, and current gateway owner
model.

The public reader-facing docs path for this area lives under
`site/use-loong/`, especially `configuration-patterns.mdx`,
`channels.mdx`, `channel-guides/index.mdx`, `channel-recipes.mdx`, and
`gateway-and-supervision.mdx`. This file stays longer because it is the
source-level contract behind those pages.

## Read This File When

- you need the exact shipped boundary between runtime-backed channels,
  config-backed outbound surfaces, and catalog-only planned surfaces
- you are reviewing required config, commands, or readiness rules for one
  shipped surface
- you are checking whether a surface is part of gateway-owned supervision or
  outbound-only delivery
- you need the repo-native source contract behind the public Mintlify guides

## User Story

As a user who wants Loong outside the terminal, I want channel setup to be
legible so that I know which surfaces are available today and what each one
needs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Product docs clearly distinguish the shipped MVP surfaces: the base CLI
      assistant loop, the explicit `gateway run/status/stop` runtime-owner
      contract, runtime-backed Feishu / Lark, Telegram, Matrix, WhatsApp, and
      WeCom service channels, plus config-backed outbound Discord, Slack,
      LINE, DingTalk, Email, generic Webhook, Google Chat, Signal, Twitch,
      Tlon, Microsoft Teams, Mattermost, Nextcloud Talk, Synology Chat, IRC,
      iMessage / BlueBubbles, and Nostr.
- [ ] Product docs clearly distinguish runtime-backed shipped surfaces,
      config-backed outbound shipped surfaces, and catalog-only planned
      surfaces such as Zalo, Zalo Personal, and WebChat.
- [ ] Channel setup guidance describes required credentials, config toggles,
      and the command used to run each shipped channel today.
- [ ] Product docs describe `gateway run/status/stop` as the current explicit
      gateway owner contract and `multi-channel-serve` as the attached
      compatibility wrapper for shipped runtime-backed surfaces rather than the
      long-term product noun.
- [ ] WeCom setup guidance documents the official AIBot long-connection flow
      and never presents webhook callback mode as a supported Loong
      integration path.
- [ ] Channel setup never implies a channel is ready until its required
      credentials and runtime prerequisites are satisfied.
- [ ] Channel-specific failures surface enough context for the operator to know
      which channel or account failed and how to recover.
- [ ] Channel setup guidance keeps the base CLI assistant path independent, so
      a user can still succeed with `ask` or `chat` before enabling service
      channels.

## Out of Scope

- Shipping additional runtime-backed channels beyond CLI, Feishu / Lark,
  Telegram, Matrix, WhatsApp, and WeCom
- Promoting the remaining catalog-only planned surfaces such as Zalo,
  Zalo Personal, or WebChat to shipped support in this slice
- Broad cross-channel inbox or routing UX
- Full remote pairing flows for unshipped surfaces

## Expansion Model

Loong keeps channel expansion in four explicit layers so planned surfaces
do not overclaim runtime support:

- the channel catalog is the superset and can model planned surfaces before a
  runtime adapter exists
- config-backed outbound surfaces are a shipped subset that own credentials,
  status, and direct sends without pretending they also own a long-running
  serve runtime
- runtime-backed service channels are a strict shipped subset of the catalog
- `gateway run` is the current explicit runtime-owner contract and can run
  headless or with an attached CLI session
- `gateway status` and `gateway stop` provide the first cross-process owner
  inspection and cooperative shutdown surfaces
- `multi-channel-serve` is the attached compatibility wrapper and only
  supervises enabled runtime-backed channels while using repeatable
  `--channel-account <channel=account>` selectors instead of channel-specific
  flags
- the longer-term direction is an explicit gateway service that will own
  runtime-backed channels, route mounts, auth, detached lifecycle, and operator
  APIs without changing the registry-first channel inventory model

This lets the product align channel naming and onboarding with broader channel
ecosystems such as OpenClaw without pretending a stub catalog entry or a
send-only surface is already a shipped runtime surface.

## Surface Setup Rules

### Base Local Path

#### CLI

The base CLI path stays independent from the gateway and service channels. A
user must be able to succeed with `ask` or `chat` before enabling Feishu / Lark,
Telegram, Matrix, WhatsApp, or WeCom.

### Runtime-Backed Service Channels

#### Feishu / Lark

Feishu / Lark supports two inbound transports and the security contract depends
on the selected mode:

- both webhook and websocket modes require `app_id`, `app_secret`, and
  `allowed_chat_ids`
- webhook mode additionally requires `verification_token` and `encrypt_key`
- websocket mode must not be blocked on webhook-only secrets
- `loong feishu-send` supports both `receive_id` and `message_reply`
- `loong feishu-serve` owns the inbound reply service

#### Telegram

Telegram setup remains the simplest shipped bot surface:

- enable the channel
- provide one bot token
- allowlist trusted chat ids
- run `loong telegram-serve` for reply-loop automation
- use `loong telegram-send` for direct operator sends

#### Matrix

Matrix uses a sync-loop transport with explicit homeserver configuration:

- configure `access_token` and `base_url`
- allowlist trusted room ids
- set `user_id` when self-message filtering is enabled
- use `matrix-send` for direct room delivery and `matrix-serve` for the sync
  reply loop

#### WhatsApp

WhatsApp is shipped as a real runtime-backed surface through the Cloud API send
path plus a verified webhook reply loop:

- configure `access_token` and `phone_number_id`
- provide `verify_token` and `app_secret` for the serve path
- use `whatsapp-send` for proactive sends
- use `whatsapp-serve` to own the webhook-backed reply loop
- keep `webhook_bind` and `webhook_path` explicit when local ingress ownership
  matters for the rollout

#### WeCom

WeCom is shipped as a real runtime-backed surface through the official AIBot
long-connection transport:

- configure `bot_id` and `secret`
- allowlist trusted `conversation_id` values through
  `wecom.allowed_conversation_ids`
- use `wecom-serve` to own the long connection and auto-reply loop
- use `wecom-send` for proactive sends when no active `wecom-serve` session is
  holding the same bot account
- optional transport tuning belongs in `wecom.websocket_url`,
  `wecom.ping_interval_s`, and `wecom.reconnect_interval_s`

Loong does not support a WeCom webhook callback mode on this surface. The
runtime contract is explicitly the official AIBot websocket subscription flow.

### Config-Backed Outbound Surfaces

Discord, Slack, LINE, DingTalk, Email, generic Webhook, Google Chat, Signal,
Twitch, Tlon, Microsoft Teams, Mattermost, Nextcloud Talk, Synology Chat,
IRC, iMessage / BlueBubbles, and Nostr are shipped as account-aware outbound
surfaces:

- they publish send commands, config validation, inventory snapshots, and
  onboarding metadata through the shared channel SDK
- they do not join `multi-channel-serve` because they do not own a shipped
  reply-loop runtime
- their `serve` metadata remains planned or unsupported until the gateway layer
  and the underlying inbound transport contract are implemented
- their HTTP targets must use `http` or `https`, must not embed credentials,
  block private or special-use hosts by default, and do not auto-follow
  redirects
- operators who intentionally send through a private bridge, loopback service,
  or self-hosted endpoint should set `[outbound_http] allow_private_hosts = true`
  at the top level of `loong.toml`

#### Straightforward API Or Webhook Sends

Discord, Slack, LINE, DingTalk, Google Chat, and Mattermost stay in the
simplest config-backed outbound bucket for this spec slice:

- the matrix above is the canonical source for required config keys and send
  commands
- these surfaces remain outbound-only even when their upstream platforms also
  support richer bot or event contracts
- they should not be described as shipped serve runtimes until Loong owns
  the corresponding inbound contract and gateway supervision model

#### Detailed Outbound Surface Notes

##### Webhook

Generic Webhook is shipped as a minimal config-backed outbound POST surface:

- configure `webhook.endpoint_url` or account-specific
  `webhook.accounts.<account>.endpoint_url`
- optionally configure `auth_token`, `auth_header_name`, and
  `auth_token_prefix` when the remote endpoint expects bearer-like or custom
  header authentication
- use `webhook.payload_format = "json_text"` to send a JSON object with one
  text field, or `webhook.payload_format = "plain_text"` to send the raw body
- use `webhook.payload_text_field` to control the JSON field name for
  `json_text` payloads
- use `webhook-send` without `--target` to send to the configured endpoint, or
  override the endpoint with `--target` for one-off delivery
- `webhook.public_base_url` and `webhook.signing_secret` remain reserved for
  the planned inbound serve contract and are not required for send readiness

##### Signal

Signal is shipped through a `signal-cli` REST bridge send surface:

- configure `signal.account`
- use `signal.service_url` to point at the bridge; when unset, Loong
  defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
- because outbound HTTP delivery defaults to public-only mode, the default
  local bridge requires `[outbound_http] allow_private_hosts = true`
- use `signal-send` with a Signal account target such as an E.164 number
- `signal-serve` remains planned until Loong owns a real inbound listener
  contract

##### Email

Email is shipped through an SMTP outbound surface:

- configure `email.smtp_host`, `email.smtp_username`, `email.smtp_password`,
  and `email.from_address`
- `email.smtp_host` may be either a bare relay host such as
  `smtp.example.com` or a full `smtp://` or `smtps://` URL when the operator
  needs an explicit port
- use `email-send` with an email address target
- the outbound surface sends plain-text mail and derives the subject from the
  first non-empty line of the message body
- `email-serve` remains planned until Loong owns an IMAP-backed reply-loop
  runtime

##### Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams is shipped through the incoming webhook send surface:

- configure `teams.webhook_url` for outbound delivery
- use `teams-send` without an explicit target to post into the configured
  webhook, or override the webhook with `--target` when the operator needs a
  one-off endpoint
- `teams.app_id`, `teams.app_password`, `teams.tenant_id`, and
  `teams.allowed_conversation_ids` remain reserved for the planned bot event
  runtime and are not required for send readiness today
- `teams-serve` remains planned until Loong owns the bot-framework style
  inbound contract

##### Twitch

Twitch is shipped through the official Twitch Chat API send surface:

- enable the surface with `twitch.enabled = true`
- configure `twitch.access_token` or `twitch.access_token_env` with a Twitch
  user access token that carries `user:write:chat`
- use `twitch.account_id` when the operator wants an explicit runtime account
  identity label for the default config
- use `twitch.default_account` and `twitch.accounts.<account>` when the
  deployment needs multiple Twitch identities or environment-specific tokens
- use `twitch-send` with a channel login or broadcaster id target
- Loong validates the token at send time to derive the sender user id and
  client id instead of duplicating those identifiers in config
- `twitch.api_base_url` and `twitch.oauth_base_url` stay overridable for tests
  and controlled environments
- `twitch.channel_names` remains reserved for the planned EventSub or
  chat-listener serve path

Example:

```toml
[twitch]
enabled = true
default_account = "ops"
channel_names = ["main-stream"]

[twitch.access_token]
env = "TWITCH_ACCESS_TOKEN"

[twitch.accounts.ops]
account_id = "twitch-ops"

[twitch.accounts.ops.access_token]
env = "TWITCH_OPS_ACCESS_TOKEN"

[twitch.accounts.backup]
enabled = false
account_id = "twitch-backup"
access_token_env = "TWITCH_BACKUP_ACCESS_TOKEN"
channel_names = ["backup-stream"]
```

Resolution notes:

- when `--account` is omitted, Loong selects `twitch.default_account` if it
  is configured, otherwise it falls back to the single configured account or the
  sorted first account key
- `twitch.accounts.<account>.access_token` or
  `twitch.accounts.<account>.access_token_env` override the top-level token only
  for that account
- `twitch.accounts.<account>.account_id` overrides the top-level
  `twitch.account_id` for the resolved runtime identity

##### Tlon

Tlon is shipped through the outbound Urbit ship poke surface:

- configure `tlon.ship`, `tlon.url`, and `tlon.code`
- `tlon.url` may omit the scheme; Loong normalizes bare hosts to `https://`
- use `tlon-send` with DM targets such as `~sampel-palnet` or
  `dm:~sampel-palnet`
- use `tlon-send` with group targets such as `chat/~host-ship/channel` or
  `group:~host-ship/channel`
- Loong authenticates to the configured ship, reuses the returned session
  cookie for one HTTP poke, and fails fast if login or poke acknowledgement
  does not succeed
- `tlon-serve` remains planned until Loong owns a stable inbound Urbit
  subscription and reply-loop runtime

##### Nextcloud Talk

Nextcloud Talk is shipped through the official bot API send surface:

- configure `nextcloud_talk.server_url` and `nextcloud_talk.shared_secret`
- use `nextcloud-talk-send` with a conversation token target
- `nextcloud-talk-serve` remains planned until Loong owns the inbound bot
  callback contract

##### Synology Chat

Synology Chat is shipped through the incoming webhook send surface:

- configure `synology_chat.incoming_url`
- use `synology-chat-send` with no explicit target to post into the webhook's
  bound room
- optionally pass a numeric user id target when the operator wants the webhook
  to direct-message a specific Synology Chat user
- `synology_chat.token` is reserved for a future outbound webhook serve
  contract and is not required for send readiness today
- `synology-chat-serve` remains planned until Loong owns the outbound
  webhook callback contract

##### IRC

IRC is shipped through a config-backed socket send surface:

- configure `irc.server` with either a bare host, an `irc://host[:port]`
  endpoint, or an `ircs://host[:port]` endpoint
- configure `irc.nickname` for the bot identity used during registration
- optionally configure `irc.username`, `irc.realname`, and `irc.password`
- when `irc.password` is set, use an `ircs://` endpoint so Loong does not
  send `PASS` over plaintext transport
- optionally configure `irc.channel_names` when the operator wants status
  snapshots to advertise the preferred channel set for that account
- use `irc-send` with a single conversation target such as `#ops` for a
  channel or a nick for a direct message
- `irc-serve` remains planned until Loong owns a long-lived relay-loop
  contract for IRC traffic

##### iMessage / BlueBubbles

iMessage is shipped through a BlueBubbles bridge send surface:

- configure `imessage.bridge_url` and `imessage.bridge_token`
- use `imessage-send` with a BlueBubbles `chatGuid` target
- `imessage.allowed_chat_ids` remains reserved for a future inbound bridge-sync
  runtime and is not required for send readiness today
- `imessage-serve` remains planned until Loong owns the inbound bridge
  synchronization contract

##### Nostr

Nostr is shipped as a signed relay-publish surface:

- configure one or more relay URLs through `nostr.relay_urls`
- configure a signing key through `nostr.private_key`; both raw hex and `nsec`
  input are accepted, but Loong normalizes internally to the standard hex
  representation
- use `nostr-send` to publish a regular text-note event and wait for relay `OK`
  acknowledgements from the configured relay set
- `nostr-send` may omit `--target` for a plain public note, or pass a public
  key target to attach a `p` tag to the outbound event
- `nostr.allowed_pubkeys` remains reserved for the planned inbound relay
  subscriber path and is not required for send readiness today

## Gateway Ownership Direction

`gateway run/status/stop` is the current explicit owner contract for the
shipped runtime-backed service-channel subset. `multi-channel-serve` remains
the attached compatibility wrapper rather than the long-term product noun:

- `gateway run` can claim the persisted owner slot headless or attach a CLI
  host when `--session` is provided
- `gateway status` can inspect the persisted owner snapshot from another CLI
  process
- `gateway stop` can request cooperative shutdown from another CLI process
- `multi-channel-serve` uses the same gateway owner contract while preserving
  the attached CLI-first workflow for operators who want one foreground session
- `multi-channel-serve` keeps the concurrent CLI host in the foreground
- it supervises every enabled runtime-backed surface from the loaded config
- it accepts repeatable `--channel-account <channel=account>` selectors to pin
  specific accounts such as `telegram=bot_123456`, `feishu=work`
  (or the accepted alias `lark=work`), `matrix=bridge-sync`, or
  `wecom=robot-prod`
- those selectors should resolve against configured `accounts.<id>` entries;
  if named accounts do not exist yet, the operator should finish the normal
  per-channel setup first instead of inventing selector ids ad hoc
- it never promotes config-backed outbound surfaces such as Signal, Email,
  generic Webhook, Microsoft Teams, DingTalk, Google Chat, Twitch, Tlon,
  Mattermost, Nextcloud Talk, Synology Chat, IRC, or iMessage / BlueBubbles
  into runtime supervision until those adapters grow real serve ownership
- it never promotes catalog-only planned surfaces such as Zalo, Zalo Personal,
  or WebChat into runtime supervision until those adapters are implemented
- the gateway service should continue to absorb this runtime ownership model,
  then add detached service lifecycle, route mounting, status/log surfaces,
  pairing, and richer gateway-native channel runtimes on top of the same
  registry-driven inventory contract
