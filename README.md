## Why LoongClaw?

LoongClaw is a layered Agentic OS kernel focused on stable kernel contracts, strict policy boundaries, and pluggable runtime orchestration. Core and business logic are strictly separated:

- **Minimal, stable core** -- handles only policy, security, and audit. No business logic in the kernel.
- **Security cannot be bypassed** -- every tool call, memory operation, and connector invocation is gated by the policy engine. High-risk actions require explicit human authorization.
- **Business logic lives in extension planes** -- providers, tools, channels, and memory backends are all replaceable adapters that never touch the kernel.
- **Multi-language plugins** -- supports Rust, WASM, and process plugins in any language. The community can extend freely.
- **Bidirectional integration** -- can be embedded as a kernel into other systems, or connect to external services via adapters.
- **Operator-ready product layer** -- onboarding, personalities, memory profiles, and legacy claw import are all first-class runtime capabilities.

## Alpha-Test Highlights

- `setup` bootstraps a beginner-friendly TOML config and local SQLite memory.
- `chat` provides an interactive CLI channel with sliding-window conversation memory.
- Core tool runtime currently ships `shell.exec`, `file.read`, and `file.write`.
- Conversation runtime now exposes a pluggable `context engine` seam with explicit lifecycle hooks
  (`bootstrap`, `ingest`, `assemble`, `after_turn`, `compact_context`) plus reserved subagent
  hooks for future multi-agent orchestration.
- Context assembly now carries richer metadata (`messages`, optional `estimated_tokens`, optional
  `system_prompt_addition`) so policy-driven prompt shaping and compaction can evolve without
  breaking the trait surface.
- Context engine selection supports config and env override:
  - config: `[conversation] context_engine = "default|legacy|<custom_id>"`
  - env: `LOONGCLAW_CONTEXT_ENGINE=<engine_id>`
- ACP is modeled as a separate control plane instead of being folded into provider turns or context
  assembly.
- Built-in `acpx` backend now supports session lifecycle, turn execution, cancellation, status
  inspection, config patching, doctor diagnostics, and backend-local MCP server injection.
- ACP agent selection is now an explicit control-plane policy instead of a backend heuristic:
  - config: `[acp] default_agent = "codex"`
  - config: `[acp] allowed_agents = ["codex", "claude"]`
  - conversation routes now derive `session_key = agent:<selected_agent>:<session_id>` and reject
    disallowed agent prefixes early.
- ACP dispatch is now a separate policy seam instead of being implied by `[acp].enabled`:
  - config: `[acp.dispatch] enabled = true`
  - config: `[acp.dispatch] conversation_routing = "all"|"agent_prefixed_only"`
  - config: `[acp.dispatch] allowed_channels = ["telegram", "feishu"]`
  - config: `[acp.dispatch] allowed_account_ids = ["work-bot", "lark-prod"]`
  - config: `[acp.dispatch] thread_routing = "all"|"thread_only"|"root_only"`
  - this keeps “ACP control plane exists” separate from “which conversation turns default into ACP”
    so mixed provider/ACP operation and future thread binding do not require a route-layer rewrite.
  - channel filtering is evaluated against the underlying conversation route, even when the session
    is already agent-prefixed.
  - account filtering and thread/root filtering are evaluated against the typed conversation
    address (`channel/account/conversation/thread`) when available, then fall back to legacy
    `session_id` parsing for compatibility.
- Channel-originated turns now pass a typed session address (`channel/account/conversation/thread`)
  into ACP dispatch before any legacy `session_id` parsing, pre-embedding future account/thread
  binding rules without changing the public conversation/runtime seams again.
- ACP session bindings now persist a typed `binding_route_session_id` in addition to legacy
  `conversation_id`, so future account/thread-scoped ACP reuse does not depend on opaque aliases.
- ACP bootstrap now also carries an explicit typed binding scope into the control plane, so session
  reuse does not depend on re-parsing metadata alone.
- When `[acp].enabled = true` and ACP dispatch allows the session, CLI/channel turns route through
  the ACP manager with stable `conversation_id` and derived `session_key`, pre-wiring future
  persistent bindings and per-channel ACP routing without a conversation-runtime rewrite.
- When `[acp].emit_runtime_events = true`, ACP-routed turns persist structured
  `acp_turn_event` / `acp_turn_final` records into conversation history so daemon-side summaries
  and future OpenClaw-style streaming or telemetry surfaces can evolve without changing the ACP
  manager/backend seam again. Those persisted records now also carry explicit `agent_id`, so
  observability does not need to reverse-engineer identity only from `session_key`. They also keep
  `routing_intent` / `routing_origin`, while ACP session status surfaces keep
  `activation_origin`, so operators can distinguish explicit ACP entry from automatic ACP routing.
- The daemon now exposes operator-facing diagnostics for:
  - `list-context-engines`
  - `list-acp-backends`
  - `list-acp-sessions`
  - `acp-doctor`
  - `acp-dispatch`
  - `acp-event-summary`
  - `acp-status`
  - `acp-observability`

  `acp-dispatch` now reports not only whether automatic ACP routing is allowed, but also the
  predicted automatic routing origin (`automatic_agent_prefixed` vs `automatic_dispatch`) when the
  session would enter ACP.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust stable toolchain (edition 2024)
- `cargo` available in your PATH

### Install from Source

<details>
<summary>Linux / macOS</summary>

```bash
./scripts/install.sh --onboard
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows (PowerShell)</summary>

```powershell
pwsh ./scripts/install.ps1 -Onboard
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Manual (Cargo)</summary>

```bash
cargo install --path crates/daemon
```
</details>

`--onboard` runs `loongclaw onboard` without `--force`, so rerunning this quickstart will stop before overwriting an existing config.

### First Chat in Under 5 Minutes

1. Run guided onboarding:

   ```bash
   loongclaw onboard
   ```

2. Set your provider API key:

   ```bash
   export PROVIDER_API_KEY=sk-...
   ```

3. Start chatting:

   ```bash
   loongclaw chat
   ```

   Use `loongclaw chat --acp` when you want this chat session to route turns through ACP
   explicitly. Without `--acp` or other ACP-specific chat flags, normal chat stays on the default
   provider/context-engine path.

Run `loongclaw doctor --fix` if anything goes wrong.

### Run Tests

```bash
cargo test --workspace --all-features
```

## Prompt And Personality

LoongClaw ships with a native prompt pack and three default personalities. All
three personalities keep the same security-first boundaries; they only change
tone, initiative, confirmation style, and response density.

- `calm_engineering`: rigorous, direct, and technically grounded
- `friendly_collab`: warm, cooperative, and explanatory when helpful
- `autonomous_executor`: decisive, high-initiative, and execution-oriented

Interactive onboarding now defaults to personality selection, while advanced
operators can still pass `--system-prompt` for a full inline override.

## Memory Profiles

LoongClaw separates memory behavior from the storage backend. The current
backend is SQLite, with three operator-selectable context injection modes:

- `window_only`: only the recent sliding window is loaded
- `window_plus_summary`: earlier turns are condensed into a summary block
- `profile_plus_window`: a durable `profile_note` block is injected before the recent window

`profile_note` is the first migration-friendly durable memory lane. It is meant
to carry imported claw identity, stable preferences, or long-lived operator
tuning without forcing everything into the system prompt.

## Migration And Import

LoongClaw can discover legacy claw homes during onboarding and offer an import
before the rest of onboarding continues.

- Recommended path: import a single highest-confidence source.
- Advanced path: plan multiple sources, merge only the profile lane, and keep prompt/system identity single-source.
- Safety defaults: secrets are not migrated, imported runtime identity is normalized to `LoongClaw`, and every apply creates a backup manifest with rollback support.

CLI migration workflow:

- Default mode is now `plan` (safe preview, no file write) when `--mode` is omitted.
- `apply_selected` accepts both `--source-id` and alias `--selection-id`.
- Safe merge accepts both `--primary-source-id` and alias `--primary-selection-id`.
- `map_external_skills` builds a deterministic external-skills mapping plan.
- `--apply-external-skills-plan` can attach that mapping into `profile_note` during `apply_selected`.
- applying external-skills plan also writes `.loongclaw-migration/<config>.external-skills.json` for audit and replay.

```bash
# Discover and score import candidates under a root
loongclaw import-claw --mode discover --input ~/legacy-claws

# Plan all candidates and print recommendation
loongclaw import-claw --mode plan_many --input ~/legacy-claws

# Preview external skills mapping artifacts and generated profile addendum
loongclaw import-claw --mode map_external_skills --input ~/legacy-claws

# Apply one selected source to a target config
loongclaw import-claw --mode apply_selected --input ~/legacy-claws \
  --source-id openclaw --output ~/.loongclaw/config.toml --force

# Apply selected source and also attach external-skills mapping addendum
loongclaw import-claw --mode apply_selected --input ~/legacy-claws \
  --source-id openclaw --output ~/.loongclaw/config.toml \
  --apply-external-skills-plan --force

# Roll back the last apply_selected/import apply for this output config
loongclaw import-claw --mode rollback_last_apply --output ~/.loongclaw/config.toml
```

## External Skills Runtime Guardrails

External skills runtime is now safety-first by default and explicitly opt-in:

- `external_skills.enabled = false` by default (downloads/runtime disabled).
- `external_skills.require_download_approval = true` by default.
- Domain blocklist has priority over every other rule.
- If `allowed_domains` is non-empty, only allowlisted domains can be downloaded.
- `external_skills.fetch` blocks redirects to avoid silent cross-domain hops.

Recommended config baseline:

```toml
[external_skills]
enabled = true
require_download_approval = true
allowed_domains = ["skills.sh", "clawhub.io"]
blocked_domains = ["*.evil.example"]
auto_expose_installed = true
```

Agent-facing tools:

- `external_skills_policy`
  - `action=get` reads effective runtime policy.
  - `action=set` updates enable/approval/domain policy at runtime (requires `policy_update_approved=true`).
  - `action=reset` clears runtime overrides back to config defaults (requires `policy_update_approved=true`).
- `external_skills_fetch`
  - Requires `url`.
  - Requires `approval_granted=true` when approval guard is enabled.
  - Saves artifact under `<tools.file_root>/external-skills-downloads/`.
  - Enforces allowlist/blocklist before network download.
- `external_skills_install`
  - Requires local `path`.
  - Accepts a directory containing `SKILL.md` or a local `.tgz` / `.tar.gz` archive.
  - Installs the skill under `<tools.file_root>/external-skills-installed/` by default.
- `external_skills_list`
  - Lists managed installed skills that are available for invocation.
- `external_skills_inspect`
  - Returns metadata and a short preview for an installed skill.
- `external_skills_invoke`
  - Loads an installed skill's `SKILL.md` instructions into the conversation loop.
- `external_skills_remove`
  - Removes a managed installed skill and updates the local index.

Recommended runtime flow:

1. Download with `external_skills.fetch`
2. Install with `external_skills.install`
3. Discover with `external_skills.list`
4. Load instructions with `external_skills.invoke`

## Architecture Overview

LoongClaw is organized as a 7-crate workspace with a strict dependency DAG:

```text
contracts (leaf -- zero internal deps)
├── kernel --> contracts
├── protocol (independent leaf)
├── app --> contracts, kernel
├── spec --> contracts, kernel, protocol
├── bench --> contracts, kernel, spec
└── daemon (binary) --> all of the above
```

| Crate | Role |
|-------|------|
| `contracts` | Shared types, capability model. Zero deps -- the stable ABI surface. |
| `kernel` | Policy engine, audit timeline, capability tokens, plugin system, integration catalog, pack boundaries. |
| `protocol` | Transport contracts, typed routing. Independent leaf. |
| `app` | Providers, tools, channels, memory, configuration, conversation engine. |
| `spec` | Execution spec runner for deterministic test scenarios. |
| `bench` | Benchmark harness and gate enforcement. |
| `daemon` | CLI binary (`loongclaw`). Wires everything into runnable commands. |

For the full layered execution model (L0-L9), see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Feature Flags

All flags are enabled by default via the `mvp` meta-feature. You can disable defaults and
enable only what you need for minimal builds.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `config-toml` | TOML configuration loader |
| `memory-sqlite` | SQLite conversation memory |
| `tool-shell` | `shell.exec` tool |
| `tool-file` | `file.read` / `file.write` tools |
| `channel-cli` | Interactive CLI channel |
| `channel-telegram` | Telegram polling adapter |
| `channel-feishu` | Feishu encrypted webhook adapter |
| `provider-openai` | OpenAI-compatible provider |
| `provider-volcengine` | Volcengine custom endpoint |

Example minimal build:

```bash
cargo build -p loongclaw-daemon --no-default-features --features "channel-cli,provider-openai,config-toml,memory-sqlite"
```

## Design Principles

1. **Kernel-first** -- all execution paths route through the kernel's capability, policy, and audit system. No shadow paths.
2. **No breaking changes** -- new features are additive only. Existing public API signatures stay unchanged.
3. **Capability-gated by default** -- every operation requires a valid `CapabilityToken` with matching capabilities.
4. **Audit everything security-critical** -- policy denials, token lifecycle events, and module invocations all emit structured events.
5. **7-crate DAG, no cycles** -- dependency direction is non-negotiable.
6. **Tests first** -- if a behavior isn't tested, it doesn't exist.
7. **Proven technology preferred** -- choose well-understood, composable dependencies over opaque packages.
8. **Repository is the system of record** -- if it's not in the repo, it doesn't exist for agents.
9. **Automate first** -- linters, CI gates, and pre-commit hooks over code review comments.
10. **Strictly avoid over-engineering** -- minimum complexity for the current task is the right amount.

## Configuration

`loongclaw onboard` defaults to referencing provider credentials through `provider.api_key`, so secrets stay outside the config file:

```toml
[provider]
kind = "openai"
api_key = "${PROVIDER_API_KEY}"    # preferred explicit env reference
```

`provider.api_key` also accepts `$PROVIDER_API_KEY`, `env:PROVIDER_API_KEY`, `%PROVIDER_API_KEY%`, or a direct literal like `api_key = "sk-..."`.
Legacy `api_key_env = "PROVIDER_API_KEY"` remains supported for compatibility, but new configs should prefer `provider.api_key`.

Volcengine Coding Plan / ARK demo:

```toml
[provider]
kind = "volcengine"
model = "your-coding-plan-model-id"
api_key = "${ARK_API_KEY}"
base_url = "https://ark.cn-beijing.volces.com"
chat_completions_path = "/api/v3/chat/completions"
```

`kind = "volcengine"` already applies the Volcengine defaults above, so `base_url` and `chat_completions_path` are only needed when you want the config to spell them out explicitly.

Provider model-catalog cache tuning:

```toml
[provider]
model = "auto"
# Fresh cache window for /v1/models (default: 30000, max: 300000; set 0 to disable cache)
model_catalog_cache_ttl_ms = 30000
# Extra stale window used only when model-list fetch fails (default: 120000, max: 600000)
model_catalog_stale_if_error_ms = 120000
# Cache entry capacity for model catalogs (default: 32, range: 1-256)
model_catalog_cache_max_entries = 32
# Base cooldown window for model candidates rejected as incompatible (default: 300000, max: 3600000; set 0 to disable)
model_candidate_cooldown_ms = 300000
# Exponential backoff cap for repeated candidate failures (default: 3600000, max: 86400000)
model_candidate_cooldown_max_ms = 3600000
# Cache entry capacity for model candidate cooldown state (default: 64, range: 1-512)
model_candidate_cooldown_max_entries = 64
# Base cooldown for auth profiles after transient failures (default: 60000, max: 3600000; set 0 to disable)
profile_cooldown_ms = 60000
# Max cooldown cap for repeated profile failures (default: 3600000, max: 86400000)
profile_cooldown_max_ms = 3600000
# Disable window for auth-rejected profiles (default: 21600000, range: 60000-604800000)
profile_auth_reject_disable_ms = 21600000
# In-memory profile-state capacity per runtime namespace (default: 256, range: 1-1024)
profile_state_max_entries = 256
# Profile-state persistence backend ("file" or "sqlite", default: "file")
profile_state_backend = "file"
# Profile health enforcement mode ("provider_default", "enforce", "observe_only"; default: "provider_default")
# provider_default currently maps openrouter -> observe_only, others -> enforce
profile_health_mode = "provider_default"
# Optional sqlite file path when backend = "sqlite" (defaults to ~/.loongclaw/provider-profile-state.sqlite3)
profile_state_sqlite_path = "~/.loongclaw/provider-profile-state.sqlite3"
```
