***Secure, extensible, and sustainably evolvable*** — Loong is an agent base for vertical AI agents, built in Rust. On a secure and controlled base, it supports longer-horizon workflow construction, compound task execution, and closed-loop improvement — enabling people and AI to collaborate in real-world scenarios.

## Why Loong

**Because it already has the core capabilities you need to inspect, operate, and extend:**

- **🚀 Rich configuration out of the box**: 42+ built-in providers, 25+ channels — up and running in a few commands.
- **👀 Transparent and controllable**: `audit`, `tasks`, `skills`, `plugins`, `channels`, `runtime-snapshot`, and gateway control are all exposed as directly usable commands.
- **🛡️ Secure and controllable base**: provider selection, tools, memory, channels, approvals, policy, and audit operate within explicit runtime boundaries.

**Also because whether you are a beginner or a power user, it fits you:**

- **⚡ Easy to start**: a few commands to get running, compatible with existing configurations from OpenClaw, Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and other similar AI tools.
- **🧭 Transparent boundaries**: assistant, gateway, and channels operate independently — never tangled together.
- **🔌 Core and extensions are separate**: providers, tools, channels, memory, and policy live outside the kernel — compile and compose as needed.
- **🌱 Not a toy**: designed for long-term use, grows with your needs over time.

## Quick Start

> Loong uses `loong` as the only supported command-line entrypoint.

### Script Install (Recommended)

Linux or macOS:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eastreams/loong/dev/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --onboard
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$script = Join-Path $env:TEMP "loong-install.ps1"
Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eastreams/loong/dev/scripts/install.ps1 -OutFile $script
pwsh $script -Onboard
```

From source:

Ensure your system has a C linker (required by Rust):

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential
```

```bash
# Fedora
sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"
```

```bash
# macOS
xcode-select --install
```

Install the Rust toolchain (skip if already installed):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

Build and install:

```bash
bash scripts/install.sh --source --onboard
```

```bash
# Or install via Cargo only (without onboard setup)
cargo install --path crates/daemon
```

### First Successful Flow

```bash
loong onboard                # Interactive setup — configure provider and model
```

```bash
loong ask --message "Summarize this repo in one sentence."  # Single-turn query to verify config
loong chat                   # Start a multi-turn conversation
loong doctor --fix           # Check environment and auto-fix common issues
```

Running `onboard` is enough for the golden path — it writes a working config to `~/.loong/config.toml` without asking you to hand-edit TOML. The snippets below show what that file looks like on `dev` today, when you want to add another provider or wire up a channel.

#### Providers

```toml
active_provider = "openai"

[providers.openai]
kind = "openai"
api_key = { env = "OPENAI_API_KEY" }
model = "auto"

[providers.volcengine]
kind = "volcengine"
api_key = { env = "ARK_API_KEY" }
model = "auto"
```

- `active_provider` selects which lane runs; switch by editing the field or by running `loong onboard` again.
- `api_key = { env = "OPENAI_API_KEY" }` reads the secret from that environment variable. `api_key = "OPENAI_API_KEY"` would instead treat the string as the literal key value — a common pitfall.
- `model = "auto"` uses provider-side discovery; pin `model = "<id>"` when discovery is unreliable for your region or account.

#### Channels — Lark

```toml
[feishu]
enabled = true
domain = "lark"                           # use "feishu" for the China Feishu lane
mode = "websocket"
receive_id_type = "chat_id"
app_id = { env = "LARK_APP_ID" }
app_secret = { env = "LARK_APP_SECRET" }
allowed_chat_ids = ["oc_ops_room"]
```

Smoke-test before anything else:

```bash
loong doctor
loong feishu-send --receive-id "ou_example_user" --text "hello from loong"
loong feishu-serve
```

For the full provider and channel matrices, multi-account setups, and the long-running delivery model, see the [Documentation](#documentation) table below.

## Architecture

Loong is a 7-crate Rust workspace with a strict acyclic dependency graph,
organized around a governed kernel that separates contracts, security,
execution, and orchestration.

```text
contracts  (stable contract vocabulary)
├── kernel   -> contracts
├── protocol (independent transport foundation)
├── app      -> contracts, kernel
├── spec     -> contracts, kernel, protocol
├── bench    -> kernel, spec
└── daemon   -> app, bench, contracts, kernel, spec
```

For ownership zones, the layered execution model (L0–L9), and design
principles, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).
