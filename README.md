## Why LoongClaw?

LoongClaw is a layered Agentic OS kernel focused on stable kernel contracts, strict policy boundaries, and pluggable runtime orchestration. Core and business logic are strictly separated:

- **Minimal, stable core** -- handles only policy, security, and audit. No business logic in the kernel.
- **Security cannot be bypassed** -- every tool call, memory operation, and connector invocation is gated by the policy engine. High-risk actions require explicit human authorization.
- **Business logic lives in extension planes** -- providers, tools, channels, and memory backends are all replaceable adapters that never touch the kernel.
- **Multi-language plugins** -- supports Rust, WASM, and process plugins in any language. The community can extend freely.
- **Bidirectional integration** -- can be embedded as a kernel into other systems, or connect to external services via adapters.
- **Operator-ready product layer** -- onboarding, personalities, memory profiles, and legacy claw import are all first-class runtime capabilities.

Run `loongclaw doctor --fix` if anything goes wrong.

### Run Tests

```bash
cargo test --workspace --all-features
```

## Prompt And Personality

LoongClaw ships with a native prompt pack and three default personalities. All
three personalities keep the same security-first boundaries; they only change
tone, initiative, confirmation style, and response density.

- `calm_engineering`: rigorous, direct, and technically grounded
- `friendly_collab`: warm, cooperative, and explanatory when helpful
- `autonomous_executor`: decisive, high-initiative, and execution-oriented

Interactive onboarding now defaults to personality selection, while advanced
operators can still pass `--system-prompt` for a full inline override.

## Memory Profiles

LoongClaw separates memory behavior from the storage backend. The current
backend is SQLite, with three operator-selectable context injection modes:

- `window_only`: only the recent sliding window is loaded
- `window_plus_summary`: earlier turns are condensed into a summary block
- `profile_plus_window`: a durable `profile_note` block is injected before the recent window

`profile_note` is the first migration-friendly durable memory lane. It is meant
to carry imported claw identity, stable preferences, or long-lived operator
tuning without forcing everything into the system prompt.

## Migration And Import

LoongClaw can discover legacy claw homes during onboarding and offer an import
before the rest of first-run setup continues.

- Recommended path: import a single highest-confidence source.
- Advanced path: plan multiple sources, merge only the profile lane, and keep prompt/system identity single-source.
- Safety defaults: secrets are not migrated, imported runtime identity is normalized to `LoongClaw`, and every apply creates a backup manifest with rollback support.

CLI migration workflow:

- Default mode is now `plan` (safe preview, no file write) when `--mode` is omitted.
- `apply_selected` accepts both `--source-id` and alias `--selection-id`.
- Safe merge accepts both `--primary-source-id` and alias `--primary-selection-id`.
- `map_external_skills` builds a deterministic external-skills mapping plan.
- `--apply-external-skills-plan` can attach that mapping into `profile_note` during `apply_selected`.
- applying external-skills plan also writes `.loongclaw-migration/<config>.external-skills.json` for audit and replay.

```bash
# Discover and score import candidates under a root
loongclaw import-claw --mode discover --input ~/legacy-claws

# Plan all candidates and print recommendation
loongclaw import-claw --mode plan_many --input ~/legacy-claws

# Preview external skills mapping artifacts and generated profile addendum
loongclaw import-claw --mode map_external_skills --input ~/legacy-claws

# Apply one selected source to a target config
loongclaw import-claw --mode apply_selected --input ~/legacy-claws \
  --source-id openclaw --output ~/.loongclaw/config.toml --force

# Apply selected source and also attach external-skills mapping addendum
loongclaw import-claw --mode apply_selected --input ~/legacy-claws \
  --source-id openclaw --output ~/.loongclaw/config.toml \
  --apply-external-skills-plan --force

# Roll back the last apply_selected/import apply for this output config
loongclaw import-claw --mode rollback_last_apply --output ~/.loongclaw/config.toml
```

## Key Features

**Kernel and Security**
- Capability-based policy engine with token lifecycle (issue, revoke, authorize)
- Human approval gates: per-call authorization or one-time full-access mode
- Plugin security scanning with `block_on_high` hard gate
- WASM static analysis (artifact paths, module size, hash pin, import policy)
- External profile integrity: checksum pinning + ed25519 signature verification
- JSONL SIEM export lane with optional fail-closed mode
- Denylist precedence over all grants

**Runtime and Execution**
- Core/Extension adapter pattern for runtime, tool, memory, and connector planes
- WASM runtime execution via Wasmtime with policy-driven resource limits
- Process-stdio and HTTP-JSON bridge lanes with protocol authorization
- Programmatic tool orchestration with batching, retry, circuit breakers, and adaptive concurrency
- Tool discovery across providers and scanned plugin descriptors

**MVP Product Layer**
- `setup` -- generate TOML config and bootstrap SQLite memory
- `onboard` -- guided first-run with preflight diagnostics
- `doctor` -- diagnostics with optional safe fixes (`--fix`) and machine-readable output (`--json`)
- `chat` -- interactive CLI with sliding-window conversation memory
- Core tools: `shell.exec`, `file.read`, `file.write`
- Providers: OpenAI-compatible, Volcengine custom endpoint
- Channels: CLI, Telegram polling, Feishu encrypted webhook

**Protocol Foundation**
- Typed transport contracts and protocol method routing
- JSON-line stream transport for stdio/pipe integration
- Linked in-memory channel transport with bounded backpressure
- Route authorization gates before handler dispatch

**Developer Experience**
- 7-crate DAG with zero cycles and strict dependency direction
- 370+ tests with strict lint/fmt CI gates at every commit
- Cargo feature flags for modular builds
- Spec-driven deterministic test execution
- Benchmark gates for programmatic pressure and WASM cache performance

## Architecture Overview

LoongClaw is organized as a 7-crate workspace with a strict dependency DAG:

```text
contracts (leaf -- zero internal deps)
├── kernel --> contracts
├── protocol (independent leaf)
├── app --> contracts, kernel
├── spec --> contracts, kernel, protocol
├── bench --> contracts, kernel, spec
└── daemon (binary) --> all of the above
```

| Crate | Role |
|-------|------|
| `contracts` | Shared types, capability model. Zero deps -- the stable ABI surface. |
| `kernel` | Policy engine, audit timeline, capability tokens, plugin system, integration catalog, pack boundaries. |
| `protocol` | Transport contracts, typed routing. Independent leaf. |
| `app` | Providers, tools, channels, memory, configuration, conversation engine. |
| `spec` | Execution spec runner for deterministic test scenarios. |
| `bench` | Benchmark harness and gate enforcement. |
| `daemon` | CLI binary (`loongclaw`). Wires everything into runnable commands. |

For the full layered execution model (L0-L9), see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Feature Flags

All flags are enabled by default via the `mvp` meta-feature. You can disable defaults and
enable only what you need for minimal builds.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `config-toml` | TOML configuration loader |
| `memory-sqlite` | SQLite conversation memory |
| `tool-shell` | `shell.exec` tool |
| `tool-file` | `file.read` / `file.write` tools |
| `channel-cli` | Interactive CLI channel |
| `channel-telegram` | Telegram polling adapter |
| `channel-feishu` | Feishu encrypted webhook adapter |
| `provider-openai` | OpenAI-compatible provider |
| `provider-volcengine` | Volcengine custom endpoint |

Example minimal build:

```bash
cargo build -p loongclaw-daemon --no-default-features --features "channel-cli,provider-openai,config-toml,memory-sqlite"
```

## Design Principles

1. **Kernel-first** -- all execution paths route through the kernel's capability, policy, and audit system. No shadow paths.
2. **No breaking changes** -- new features are additive only. Existing public API signatures stay unchanged.
3. **Capability-gated by default** -- every operation requires a valid `CapabilityToken` with matching capabilities.
4. **Audit everything security-critical** -- policy denials, token lifecycle events, and module invocations all emit structured events.
5. **7-crate DAG, no cycles** -- dependency direction is non-negotiable.
6. **Tests first** -- if a behavior isn't tested, it doesn't exist.
7. **Proven technology preferred** -- choose well-understood, composable dependencies over opaque packages.
8. **Repository is the system of record** -- if it's not in the repo, it doesn't exist for agents.
9. **Automate first** -- linters, CI gates, and pre-commit hooks over code review comments.
10. **Strictly avoid over-engineering** -- minimum complexity for the current task is the right amount.

## Configuration

`loongclaw setup` defaults to referencing provider credentials through `provider.api_key`, so secrets stay outside the config file:

```toml
[provider]
kind = "openai"
api_key = "${PROVIDER_API_KEY}"    # preferred explicit env reference
```

`provider.api_key` also accepts `$PROVIDER_API_KEY`, `env:PROVIDER_API_KEY`, `%PROVIDER_API_KEY%`, or a direct literal like `api_key = "sk-..."`.
Legacy `api_key_env = "PROVIDER_API_KEY"` remains supported for compatibility, but new configs should prefer `provider.api_key`.

Volcengine Coding Plan / ARK demo:

```toml
[provider]
kind = "volcengine"
model = "your-coding-plan-model-id"
api_key = "${ARK_API_KEY}"
base_url = "https://ark.cn-beijing.volces.com"
chat_completions_path = "/api/v3/chat/completions"
```

`kind = "volcengine"` already applies the Volcengine defaults above, so `base_url` and `chat_completions_path` are only needed when you want the config to spell them out explicitly.

Validate your config:

```bash
loongclaw validate-config --config ~/.loongclaw/config.toml --json
```
